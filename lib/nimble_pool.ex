  Handle pings due to inactivity on worker.

  Executed whenever the idle worker periodic timer verifies that a worker has been idle
  on the pool for longer than `:worker_idle_timeout` pool configuration milliseconds.

  This callback must return one of the following values:

    * `{:ok, worker_state}`: Updates worker state.

    * `{:remove, user_reason}`: The pool will proceed to the standard worker termination
        defined in `terminate_worker/3`.

    * `{:stop, user_reason}`: The entire pool process will be terminated, and `terminate_worker/3`
        will be called for every worker on the pool.

  This callback is optional.

  ## Max idle pings

  The `:max_idle_pings` pool option is useful to prevent sequencial termination of a large number
  of workers. But it is important to keep in mind the following behaviours whenever utilizing it.

    * If you are not terminating workers with `handle_ping/2`, you may end up pinging only the same
      workers over and over again because each cycle will ping only the first `:max_idle_pings` workers

    * If you are terminating workers with `handle_ping/2`, the last worker may be terminated after up to
      `worker_idle_timeout + worker_idle_timeout * ceil(number_of_workers/max_idle_pings)`
       instead of `2 * worker_idle_timeout` milliseconds of idle time.

      For instance consider a pool with 10 workers and a ping of 1 second.

      Given a negligible worker termination time and a worst case scenario where all the workers
      go idle right after a verification cycle is started,

      then without `max_idle_pings` the last worker will be terminated in the next cycle (2 seconds),

      whereas with a `max_idle_pings` of 2 the last worker will be terminated only in the 5th cycle (6 seconds).

  ## Disclaimers

    * On lazy pools, if no worker is currently on the pool the callback will never be called.
      Therefore you can not rely on this callback to terminate empty lazy pools.

    * On not lazy pools, if you return `{:remove, user_reason}` you may end up
      terminating and initializing workers at the same time every idle verification cycle.

    * On large pools, if many resources goes idle at the same cycle you may end up terminating
      a large number of workers sequentially, what could lead to the pool being unable to
      fulfill requests. See `:max_idle_pings` option to prevent this.
